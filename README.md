## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content
- When user clicks continue, the data output is randomised to produce a different set of values

## My process

- Begun by focussing on the layout of the page without any styles.
- Mobile:
    - used a 4x1 grid to layout this page on mobile devices
    - within the main grid sections with the result and summary, display flex is used to layout the items in each section
    - Javascript is used to dynamically populate the results output
    - Uses D3.js to draw the graphs

- Media queries used to dynamically adjust the grid layout based on the screen size of the device

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

- DOM manipulation
- using async/await to fetch data from a local JSON file

### Continued development

- Responsive layouts

- Footers

- JSON

- APIs

- Event Listeners
