## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- @keyframes & animations
- the horizontal rule element
- .addEventListener
- using 'position: fixed' to add a footer to the page
- the '<button>' element and not '<div>' element is used to enable keyboard navigation of a web page; which in turn makes the element interactive including for focus states
- solidified my understanding of media queries
- '.classList.toggle'

### Continued development

- 'keydown' & 'keyup' event listeners
- '.classList'
